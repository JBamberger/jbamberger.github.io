title: Android App for School Substitutions
permalink: /projects/fhgapp
---

The app started as a project at my [highschool][fhg-website]. The school had a website which lists current substitutions and changes to the course schedule. At the time, this website was very inconvenient for mobile devices, hence the idea to develop an application which can display this plan in a more readable form.
Later on, I added functionality to allow the user to set its own courses, such that all irrelevant changes are filtered out. Further, the app shows some other content from the schools web site, for example the schools blog posts.

- [FHG Application on Google Play][fhg-app-playstore]
- [FHG Application Website][fhg-app-website]

At its peak the number of users was close to 400. Since, it has fallen somewhat because the website has been replaced with a more modern version of the management software. This increased its quality and added features not included in the app.
