Welcome to my site.
My name is Jannik Bamberger and I am a student of computer science.
Accordingly, this site contains mostly CS related information.
It is just a collection of things  I found interesting or useful, so you shouldn't take things too seriously as there might be some errors.

If you have questions about something, just ask by [mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
